# SolarAI: Talk to a Database
An LLM-powered application that transforms Natural language questions into SQL queries and retrieves information from a Spatial Database of Solar Granules.It bridges the gap between complex spatial datasets and user queries, enabling seamless access to insights without requiring SQL expertise.

# What are Solar Granules?
Solar granules are small, cell-like structures visible on the Sun's surface, appearing as bright areas surrounded by darker lanes, which are essentially the tops of convection cells where hot plasma rises from the Sun's interior, cools, and then sinks back down, providing direct evidence of convection happening beneath the Sun's photosphere; their significance lies in that they offer a visual representation of this convective process and help scientists understand the dynamics and energy transfer within the Sun's outer layers<br/>
